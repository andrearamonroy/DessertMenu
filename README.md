## General Info
The project is called "Dessert Menu" but I decided Dessert Recipes is a more accurate name,
therefore, you will see Dessert Recipes on the app. 

This projects uses two endpoints the first one to fetch a list of recipes 
and the second to get the details of the recipe. 
- endpoint 1: "https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert"
- endpoint 2: "https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID"
